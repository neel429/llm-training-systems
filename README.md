## What this demonstrates

- **DDP** (DistributedDataParallel) — data-parallel training with NCCL AllReduce gradient sync across GPUs
- **FSDP** (FullyShardedDataParallel) — ZeRO-3 style sharding of model weights, gradients, and optimizer states across GPUs
- **BF16 mixed precision** — automatic mixed precision via `torch.amp` for memory-efficient training
- **Throughput & memory benchmarking** — tokens/sec, peak GPU memory, and loss tracked per run and saved to JSON

## Benchmark Results

Ran on **2× NVIDIA A100 SXM4 80GB** (NVLink interconnect) on Vast.ai. Throughput compared at step 50 across all runs for apples-to-apples comparison.  
Model: `gpt2` (~117M params) | Sequence length: 512 | Batch size: 4 | Steps: 100

| Strategy | Dtype | GPUs | Tokens/sec | Peak Mem/GPU | Final Loss |
|----------|-------|------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| DDP | BF16 | 1 | 19,092 | 5.39 GB | 3.56 |
| DDP | BF16 | 2 | 32,474 | 5.39 GB | 3.34 |
| FSDP | BF16 | 2 | 30,837 | 3.45 GB | 3.34 |

### Key takeaways

**DDP 1→2 GPU: 1.70× speedup** — realistic scaling enabled by NVLink's 600 GB/s GPU-to-GPU bandwidth, which keeps NCCL AllReduce overhead minimal relative to compute.

**FSDP vs DDP: 36% memory reduction at 7% throughput cost** — FSDP shards model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across GPUs. Each GPU holds only `1/N` of the model at rest, reconstructing full layers on-demand via AllGather during forward/backward. At GPT-2 scale the memory saving is modest; at 70B+ scale it's what makes training possible on finite hardware.

## Why FSDP over DDP for large models

DDP keeps a full model replica on every GPU. For a 70B parameter model in BF16, that's ~140 GB per GPU — impossible on an 80 GB A100. FSDP shards everything: with 8 GPUs you're down to ~17.5 GB per GPU for weights alone, before accounting for optimizer state sharding (which cuts another ~2–3× on top).

The tradeoff is communication: FSDP does AllGather before every layer's forward and backward pass, then ReduceScatter to redistribute gradients. This is why you see a ~7% throughput penalty vs DDP at small scale — the extra comms add up. At large scale the math flips: DDP becomes impossible (OOM), and FSDP is the only viable option.

## Notes on FP8

FP8 training via `torchao` requires compute capability ≥ 8.9 (RTX 4090) or ≥ 9.0 (H100). The A100 is compute capability 8.0 and does not support `torch._scaled_mm` natively. FP8 emulation mode is possible but doesn't reflect real hardware performance — so BF16 benchmarks are reported here as the honest baseline.

## A note on process

This project was built with the assistance of AI at various stages — code generation (some parts), debugging, and architecture decisions. However, every piece of generated code was read, understood, and validated before being used. Nothing was blindly copy-pasted.

The benchmarks were run on a real rented GPU (2× A100 SXM4 80GB on Vast.ai), not simulated or fabricated. The numbers were then cross-checked for correctness — for example, an initially reported 2.48× scaling figure was identified as a measurement artifact (different step counts between runs) and corrected to the honest 1.70× step-matched comparison.

The goal was to actually understand and practice using a distributed training infrastructure.
